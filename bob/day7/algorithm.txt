step 1.
Scan the targets (second element of prerequisite - target tuple). 
Make a list of target - prerequisites (u32, [u32]) TP.

step 2.
Scan the prerequisites (first element of prerequisite - target tuple).
Find the prerequisites that do not have any prerequisites on their own.
Put them into a reverse sorted list (sorted queue) SQ.

step 3.
Pop the item from the sorted queue.
Find all the targets in TP for the popped item.
If they have more then one prerequisite, 
   remove the popped item from the prerequisites list.
Else move the target (removing from TP) to SQ, and resort.

Step 4. 
Push the popped item from step 3 into a result vector RV.
Go to step 3 until there's no tuples left in TP.

Step 5.
Return RV
